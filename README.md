# Geological Survey Ireland: Hyperspectral

Geological Survey Ireland has a [core scanning](https://www.gsi.ie/en-ie/more-on-us/facilities/Pages/Core-Scanning.aspx) suite consisting of a Short-Wave Infra-red (SWIR) camera and a Medium-Wave Infra-red (MWIR) camera.

We have over 400km of drill core in our [core store](https://www.gsi.ie/en-ie/more-on-us/facilities/Pages/Core-store.aspx) and are in the process of scanning all of it. We currently have ~7Tb of data.

A sample dataset consisting of 1 box of core is available to download from the [Geological Survey Ireland website](https://www.gsi.ie/en-ie/data-and-maps/Pages/Bedrock.aspx#Hyper)

The entire dataset is freely available please contact gsi.corestore[AT]gsi.ie to discuss.

This repository will host notebooks using the sample dataset explaining some of the methods we have used in python to pre-process and process our image data.
