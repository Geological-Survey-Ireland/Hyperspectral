# Geological Survey Ireland: Hyperspectral

The Geological Survey Ireland has a core scanning suite consisting of a Short-Wave Infra-red (SWIR) camera and a Medium-Wave Infra-red (MWIR) camera.

We have over 400km of drill core in our core store and are in the process of scanning all of it. We currently have ~7Tb of data.
A sample dataset consisting of 1 box of core is available to download from the GSI website (need add link)

The entire dataset is freely available please contact gsi.corestore[AT]gsi.ie to discuss.

This repository will host notebooks using the sample dataset explaining some of the methods we have used in python to pre-process and process our image data.

#### 1. Opening and Starting with GSI Hyperpectral Data
#### 2. Denoising GSI Hyperspectral Data 
#### 3. Removing the core box from the image
